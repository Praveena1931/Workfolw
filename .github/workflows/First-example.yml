     steps:
      #Adding actions/checkout in your GitHub Actions YAML file is essential because,
      #it tells the workflow to clone your repositoryâ€™s code into the runner environment so it can actually do something with it.
      #ðŸ§  What Happens Without It?# If you skip this step, your workflow will fail with errors like:
      # file not found  #  command not recognized #   no such directory
      #Because the runner has no idea what files you're referring to â€” they were never downloaded!
      #ðŸ›¡ Bonus: It Also Handles Authentication
      #actions/checkout also:    #Authenticates using the GitHub token   #Supports checking out private repos
      # Can fetch specific branches, tags, or commits    #Works with Git LFS and submodules if needed
